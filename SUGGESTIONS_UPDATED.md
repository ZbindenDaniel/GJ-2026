# Updated Suggestions for the Concept

## What already works well
- Theme and mechanics match: picking a mask under time pressure mirrors social masking.
- The elevator-to-room cadence gives a clear rhythm and pacing.
- Rewarding a perfect match with extra hints creates positive feedback without hard gating.

## Main risks to watch
- Hard fail ("bad match = restart from the beginning") can feel too punishing unless runs are short.
- Hints based only on head/face direction might be missed under time pressure.
- If mask attributes are not instantly readable, the time limit turns into frustration.

## Updated, concrete tweaks
1) Soften failure
- Bad match drops you 1 floor, removes a hint, or adds a debuff instead of full restart.
- Full restart only if you chain multiple bad matches in a row.

2) Make hints readable fast
- Combine head turn + body orientation + a soft audio cue toward the correct door.
- Use a clear visual cue for "very good" (e.g., NPCs subtly align toward the right door).

3) Make masks legible at a glance
- Limit early levels to 2-3 attributes.
- Use clear, consistent iconography or color blocks for attributes.
- Show a short 1-2 second preview in the elevator of the room's vibe (silhouette + posture).

4) Keep room loops short
- Target 30-60 seconds per room at early levels.
- Increase difficulty by adding more NPCs and attributes, not by extending time.

## Suggested moment-to-moment loop
1) Elevator: quick preview of the next room and 1-2 key hints.
2) Timed mask pick (short, tense).
3) Enter room: NPCs react, deliver hints (strong/weak depending on match).
4) Choose one of three doors, move on.

## Difficulty progression idea
- Levels 1-2: 1 attribute difference (e.g., shape) with 3 versions.
- Levels 3-4: 2 attribute differences (e.g., shape + eye color), each with 3 versions.
- Levels 5+: 3 attribute differences (e.g., shape + eye color + another facial feature), each with 3 versions.
- NPC count scales with level; hints become subtler over time.

## Open questions to clarify
- How long should one floor/room last in minutes?
- Do you want meta-progression between runs (e.g., unlock masks or perks)?
- What is the maximum number of attributes on a mask?
- How visible should "social battery" be as a timer or stamina bar?
